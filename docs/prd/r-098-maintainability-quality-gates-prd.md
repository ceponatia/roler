# PRD: R-098 Maintainability Quality Gates

Requirement ID: R-098
Source: requirements.md Section 21
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-02

## Summary

Enforce maintainability via mandatory linting, formatting, and type checks as PR gates (ties to R-107) ensuring consistent code health and reducing defects.

## Problem / Opportunity

Inconsistent style and unchecked type issues inflate review time and defect risk. Automated gates standardize baseline quality.

## Goals

- CI fails on lint or format deviations.
- Zero `any` or non-null assertions in merged code (audited).
- Coverage threshold surfacing (not mandatory fail initially, but reported).

## Non-Goals

- Enforcing minimum coverage percentage (may add later).

## User Stories

1. As a reviewer, I focus on logic not style.
2. As a developer, I get immediate feedback locally before pushing.
3. As a maintainer, I see trend metrics for lint issue counts (target 0).

## Functional Scope

- CI pipeline steps: lint, type-check, format check.
- Local pre-push script (optional) documented.
- Reporting summary comment on PR.

## Out of Scope

- Security scanning (separate pipeline stage).

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN PR with lint errors WHEN CI runs THEN pipeline fails with list.
- GIVEN code introducing `any` WHEN lint runs THEN failure occurs.
- GIVEN passing CI WHEN merged THEN quality gates satisfied.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Lint error count (target 0).
- Type error count (target 0).

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Developer friction → Mitigation: fast incremental tooling config.

## Dependencies

- R-107 (strict TS), DS standards.

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- None (process-level).

## Performance Considerations

- Parallelize lint/type/test steps to reduce CI time.

## Operational Considerations

- Document local commands in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Open Questions

- OQ: Introduce failing coverage threshold later?

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual review enforcement — rejected (inconsistent, error-prone).

## Definition of Done

- CI gates implemented.
- Docs updated.
- Sample failing PR verified blocks merge.
