# PRD: R-102 Accessibility Compliance

Requirement ID: R-102
Source: requirements.md Section 21
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-02

## Summary

Ensure core UI flows (navigation, chat, entity editing) conform to WCAG 2.1 AA (reinforces R-074) through semantic markup, keyboard operability, focus management, and screen reader support.

## Problem / Opportunity

Accessible design broadens audience and reduces legal/ethical risk; early compliance cheaper than retrofitting.

## Goals

- All interactive elements reachable via keyboard (tab order logical).
- ARIA landmarks/labels for dynamic chat area updates.
- Automated accessibility tests integrated into CI.

## Non-Goals

- AAA compliance (beyond baseline AA).

## User Stories

1. As a keyboard-only user, I can send a chat message without a mouse.
2. As a screen reader user, I hear new streamed tokens announced contextually.
3. As a tester, I run automated a11y suites and see zero critical violations.

## Functional Scope

- Focus management on stream start/end.
- ARIA live region for incremental chat tokens.
- Axe (or similar) integration in tests.

## Out of Scope

- Localization of accessibility documentation (English only initially).

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a11y test run WHEN executed THEN no critical violations.
- GIVEN chat streaming WHEN tokens arrive THEN screen reader announces updates succinctly (debounced).
- GIVEN modal dialogs WHEN opened THEN focus trapped and returned after close.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Critical accessibility issue count (target 0).

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Live region spam → Mitigation: batching updates.

## Dependencies

- R-074 (baseline accessibility), R-070 (chat streaming UI).

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- None.

## Performance Considerations

- Batching live announcements to minimize reflows.

## Operational Considerations

- Periodic manual audit (quarterly).

## Open Questions

- OQ: Provide high-contrast theme option now or later?

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual auditing only — rejected (prone to regressions).

## Definition of Done

- Automated tests passing.
- Manual audit checklist completed.
- Documentation updated.
