# PRD: Asynchronous Processing Support (R-046)

Requirement ID: R-046
Source: requirements.md Section 11 (Jobs & Asynchronous Processing)
Status: Accepted
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-29

## Summary

Provide system support for asynchronous ingestion, re-embedding, synchronization, and upstream application tasks decoupling latency-sensitive user actions from longer-running background work.

## Problem / Opportunity

Blocking interactive requests on expensive embedding, normalization, or sync tasks hurts responsiveness and scalability. A standardized async job pipeline improves perceived performance, throughput, and resilience to transient failures.

## Goals

- Queue-based submission of long-running tasks.
- Idempotent processors for safe retries.
- Unified job metadata (type, correlation ids, attempts, timings).

## Non-Goals

- Real-time low-latency streaming computation (covered in streaming requirements R-051..R-053).
- Cross-region distributed job routing (future scale feature).

## User Stories

1. As a GM, when I import canon objects, heavy embedding runs asynchronously without locking UI.
2. As a developer, I enqueue a re-embed job and track status via an API.
3. As an operator, I view backlog and retry failed jobs safely.

## Functional Scope

- Job queue abstraction (enqueue, schedule, retry policies).
- Standard job payload envelope (id, type, createdAt, correlation keys).
- Processor base class with instrumentation hooks.

## Out of Scope

- Cron/scheduled recurring jobs (may be added later).
- DLQ visualization UI (basic metrics only initially).

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN an ingestion request WHEN large payload submitted THEN immediate 202 + job queued.
- GIVEN a transient processor failure WHEN retry policy applied THEN job eventually succeeds without duplicate side-effects.
- GIVEN duplicate enqueue attempt (same correlation) WHEN processed THEN idempotent guard prevents double work.
- All criteria trace back to R-046.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Queue Backlog Size.
- Average Job Processing Duration by Type.
- Retry Success Rate ≥95%.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Job storms saturate workers → Mitigation: Rate limit enqueue + prioritization.
- Risk: Poison messages loop retries → Mitigation: Max attempts + DLQ routing.
- Risk: Visibility gap → Mitigation: Standard status introspection endpoints.

## Dependencies

- In-memory/queue system (R-014).
- Logging & tracing (R-019).

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Redact sensitive payload fields in logs.
- Validate job payloads via shared schemas (R-025).

## Performance Considerations

- Ensure enqueue latency <5ms p95.
- Batching safe where semantics allow (embedding batches).

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- UI surfaces job status (pending, processing, failed, completed) with clear color semantics.

## Operational Considerations

- Metrics dashboard: backlog, processing duration, failure rate.
- Feature flag for new job types rollout.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R046-01: Support scheduled (delayed) jobs now or later?
- OQ-R046-02: Provide per-type concurrency limits configurable at runtime?

## Alternatives Considered

- Synchronous inline processing: Rejected (latency + reliability).
- External managed queue immediately: Rejected (cost/complexity early stage).

## Definition of Done

- Queue abstraction + processors implemented.
- Schema validation integrated.
- Metrics & basic monitoring added.

## Appendix (Optional)

Pseudo job envelope:

```json
{ "id": "j123", "type": "REEMBED", "createdAt": "...", "correlation": { "entityId": "e1" } }
```
