# PRD: Streaming Transport (R-051)

Requirement ID: R-051
Source: requirements.md Section 12 (Streaming & Realtime)
Status: Accepted
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-29

## Summary

Provide a streaming transport (SSE baseline) to deliver incremental LLM-generated tokens to clients, reducing time-to-first-content and enhancing interactivity.

## Problem / Opportunity

Waiting for full completion of generation increases perceived latency and reduces engagement. Streaming improves responsiveness and enables progressive UI enrichment.

## Goals

- SSE endpoint emitting token events.
- Heartbeat / keep-alive messages to detect disconnects.
- Backpressure handling and graceful termination (end event).

## Non-Goals

- Initial WebSocket implementation (may follow if needed for bidirectional features).
- Multiplexing multiple chats over single connection (one stream per request initially).

## User Stories

1. As a player, I see the first tokens appear quickly rather than waiting for entire response.
2. As a developer, I subscribe to events with a stable contract (type, data).
3. As an operator, I monitor streaming error rates and disconnects.

## Functional Scope

- SSE route using standard event fields.
- Events: token, done, error, heartbeat.
- Cancellation on client disconnect.

## Out of Scope

- Client-to-server streaming input mid-generation.
- Multi-room persistent session channels.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN chat request WHEN generation begins THEN first token event sent <1s under nominal load (ties to R-054).
- GIVEN client disconnect WHEN detected THEN generation aborted promptly.
- GIVEN server error WHEN occurs THEN error event emitted with code and stream closes.
- All criteria trace back to R-051.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Time to First Token (TTFT).
- Stream Completion Rate.
- Disconnect Rate.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Long-lived connections exhaust resources → Mitigation: Connection limits and timeouts.
- Risk: Missing flush causing buffering → Mitigation: Explicit flush after each token.
- Risk: Heartbeat overhead → Mitigation: Adjustable interval.

## Dependencies

- Prompt assembly (R-044).
- Retrieval pipeline (R-041 to R-043, R-042).

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- Ensure auth and authorization verified before stream start.
- Redact restricted data prior to emission.

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize per-event payload overhead.

## Accessibility and UX Notes

- Client updates aria-live region for screen readers.

## Operational Considerations

- Monitor open stream count.
- Feature flag for streaming enable or disable fallback.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R051-01: Provide resume support if connection drops.
- OQ-R051-02: Expose token pacing metrics.

## Alternatives Considered

- Polling full responses: Rejected (latency and overhead).
- WebSocket first: Rejected (higher complexity for minimal additional value initially).

## Definition of Done

- SSE endpoint implemented and documented.
- Metrics TTFT tracked.
- Tests simulate disconnect and error path.

## Appendix (Optional)

Illustrative SSE lines (escaped to avoid parser issues):

```text
event: token
[line omitted: data: {"t":"Hello"}]

event: done
```
