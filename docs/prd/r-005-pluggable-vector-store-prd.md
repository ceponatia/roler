# PRD: R-005 Pluggable Vector Store

Requirement ID: R-005
Source: requirements.md Section 2
Status: Accepted
Owner: PRODUCT
Last Updated: 2025-09-29

## Summary

Enable seamless replacement of vector backend without application logic changes via a unified retriever interface and configuration-driven selection.

## Problem / Opportunity

Coupling to a single vector backend limits scalability and performance optimization.

## Goals

- Single retriever interface abstraction
- Config/flag based backend selection
- Dual-read variance logging prior to cutover

## Non-Goals

- Automatic real-time multi-backend consensus

## User Stories

1. As an operator, I switch from pgvector to Qdrant via configuration.
2. As a developer, I implement retrieval once against the interface.
3. As a performance engineer, I compare backend scores in dual mode.

## Functional Scope

- Retriever interface with contract docs
- Backend strategy factory (env / flag)
- Dual-read wrapper logging distance deltas + latency variance

## Out of Scope

- Automatic fallback re-query on mismatch

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN env flag change THEN backend used in tests switches accordingly.
- GIVEN dual-read enabled THEN variance metrics are logged and accessible.
- Interface reference docs published with example adapter.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Variance log coverage for ≥ 95% of retrieval calls during cutover window
- Backend swap requires ≤ 1 config change and service restart

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Divergent scoring → Mitigation: score normalization layer & monitoring.

## Dependencies

- Retrieval interface (R-041..R-045)
- Logging & metrics (R-063..R-067)

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Ensure redaction of restricted fields before logging variance.

## Performance Considerations

- Dual-read overhead ≤ 2x single query latency during evaluation window.

## Operational Considerations

- Feature flag controlling dual-read activation window.

## Open Questions

- Should we persist variance metrics for historical trend analysis?

## Alternatives Considered

- Hard-coded backend (rejected: inflexible)

## Definition of Done

- Interface + at least two adapters implemented, dual-read logging validated, swap runbook documented.
