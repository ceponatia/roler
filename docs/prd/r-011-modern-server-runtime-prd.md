# PRD: Modern Server Runtime (R-011)

Requirement ID: R-011
Source: requirements.md Section 3 (Platform & Technology)
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-08-29

## Summary

Adopt and enforce a modern, actively maintained JavaScript/TypeScript server runtime (Node.js LTS 20+ baseline) with strong ESM + TypeScript ergonomics, predictable security patch cadence, and tooling compatibility to ensure long-term maintainability and developer velocity.

## Problem / Opportunity

An outdated or fragmented runtime stack increases security risk, degrades DX (slow toolchain, missing APIs), and complicates dependency management. Aligning on a single, modern, LTS-supported runtime with explicit version policy reduces upgrade friction, enables consistent performance characteristics, and supports emerging platform features (e.g., fetch API, Web Streams) without polyfills.

## Goals

- Establish a clearly documented supported runtime version range (current LTS + next).
- Enforce runtime version in CI and local dev to prevent drift.
- Provide a predictable upgrade / deprecation schedule aligned to upstream LTS cycles.

## Non-Goals

- Supporting multiple divergent server runtimes simultaneously (e.g., both Node and Deno in parallel).
- Abstracting all platform APIs behind custom wrappers beyond what is required for testability.

## User Stories

1. As a maintainer, I can view a document listing currently supported and deprecated runtime versions so that upgrade planning is straightforward.
2. As a developer, I am blocked early (pre-commit / CI) if I use an unsupported runtime version so that production parity is preserved.
3. As a security engineer, I can verify that security patch releases are adopted within the defined SLA.

## Functional Scope

- Version policy document (SUPPORTED_RUNTIMES.md) with support / grace periods.
- Tooling enforcement (engines field + CI check script).
- Canary upgrade workflow (scheduled job runs test suite on upcoming LTS release candidate).

## Out of Scope

- Benchmarking alternative runtimes (e.g., Bun, Deno) beyond a brief evaluation note.
- Providing polyfills for legacy Node versions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a developer running an unsupported Node version WHEN they run install THEN the package manager surfaces a clear warning or failure referencing the supported range.
- GIVEN CI pipeline execution WHEN runtime version < minimum documented version THEN build fails with actionable message.
- GIVEN publication of a new Node LTS release WHEN canary tests pass THEN an issue is auto-created to schedule upgrade within defined window (e.g., 30 days).
- GIVEN a deprecated version past grace period WHEN a PR attempts to set that version in engines THEN CI rejects the change.
- All criteria trace back to R-011.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Runtime Drift Incidents per Quarter: 0 (instances where production ≠ documented version).
- Mean Time to Adopt New LTS: ≤30 days from upstream LTS release.
- Percentage of CI runs on unsupported versions: 0%.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Runtime breaking change in minor/security patch → Mitigation: Canary pipeline tests nightly against latest minor.
- Risk: Developer local mismatch causing subtle bugs → Mitigation: .nvmrc / volta config + preinstall version check script.
- Risk: Slow adoption of new LTS → Mitigation: Automated issue + reminder escalation.

## Dependencies

- CI infrastructure capable of matrix builds.
- Version management tooling (nvm/volta) adoption in dev environment.

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Timely patch adoption reduces exposure window for known CVEs.
- Documented process for emergency patch upgrade (fast-track pipeline).

## Performance Considerations

- Enabling newer runtime features (e.g., native fetch, Web Streams) may reduce overhead vs polyfills.
- Monitor startup time regression during upgrades.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- Not applicable (backend infrastructure); developer documentation must be readable and concise.

## Operational Considerations

- Scheduled canary workflow (cron) executes test suite on latest LTS and current nightly.
- Feature flag not required; upgrades follow documented schedule with rollback plan.
- Alerting if canary fails consecutively (e.g., 3 runs) to prompt investigation.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R011-01: Adopt Volta vs nvm for stricter local version pinning?
- OQ-R011-02: Minimum grace period after new LTS before mandatory adoption (30 vs 45 days)?

## Alternatives Considered

- Multiple runtime support (Node + Deno): Rejected due to added test matrix complexity & fragmented ecosystem libraries.
- Pinning exact patch version only: Rejected; minor security fixes would require frequent manual updates; use semver range within LTS instead.

## Definition of Done

- Engines field and version check script merged.
- Supported runtime doc published & linked from README.
- CI fails on unsupported versions (verified test).
- Canary job operational with passing initial run.

## Appendix (Optional)

Potential file structure snippet:

SUPPORTED_RUNTIMES.md

- current: Node 20.x (LTS)
- next: Node 22.x (preview) (canary)
- deprecated: Node 18.x (grace until YYYY-MM-DD)
