# PRD: Extensible Auth Providers (R-034)

Requirement ID: R-034
Source: requirements.md Section 8 (Authentication & Authorization)
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-01

## Summary

Design the authentication subsystem to support pluggable external identity providers (e.g., OAuth, SSO) without refactoring core domain or session logic.

## Problem / Opportunity

Hard-coded auth prevents enterprise or community growth requiring alternate identity systems. An extensible adapter interface future-proofs integration while preserving current session model.

## Goals

- Provider interface abstraction (login, profile fetch, logout).
- Config-driven provider selection.
- Consistent session issuance regardless of provider.

## Non-Goals

- Implementing every provider initially (start with local, add example OAuth).
- Multi-factor authentication flows.

## User Stories

1. As an operator, I enable an OAuth provider via configuration and restart.
2. As a developer, I implement a new provider by fulfilling an interface, no domain changes.
3. As a user, I experience identical session behavior regardless of provider.

## Functional Scope

- AuthProvider interface (authenticate, getUserProfile).
- Provider registry & factory.
- Config validation for provider type + credentials.
- Mapping external profile → internal user record.

## Out of Scope

- Just-in-time role provisioning beyond simple mapping.
- SSO logout propagation across all clients (future).

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN provider=oAuth WHEN credentials valid THEN session created and user stored/updated.
- GIVEN unsupported provider id WHEN startup THEN process aborts with clear error.
- GIVEN new provider implementation WHEN tests run THEN contract type checks pass.
- All criteria trace back to R-034.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Auth Provider Switch Time: <10 min.
- New Provider Implementation Lines (indicative simplicity): Tracked.
- Authentication Success Rate by Provider.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Provider-specific schema differences → Mitigation: Normalization layer.
- Risk: Credential leakage → Mitigation: Env validation + secret storage.
- Risk: Fragmented logging → Mitigation: Unified auth event emission.

## Dependencies

- Session auth (R-031).
- Error codes (R-030).

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Secure storage for client secrets.
- Minimal data persisted from external profiles.

## Performance Considerations

- Cache provider discovery documents where applicable.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- UI surfaces consistent messages across providers.

## Operational Considerations

- Feature flag: AUTH_PROVIDER.
- Health check includes provider readiness where possible.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R034-01: Support multiple providers concurrently?
- OQ-R034-02: Fallback to local provider if external outage?

## Alternatives Considered

- Hard-coded single auth method: Rejected (limits adoption).
- External gateway service abstraction now: Rejected (premature complexity).

## Definition of Done

- Provider interface & at least one external adapter implemented.
- Config + registry documented.
- Tests cover provider swap path.

## Appendix (Optional)

Interface sketch:

```ts
interface AuthProvider { authenticate(code: string): Promise<UserProfile>; }
```
