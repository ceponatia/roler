# PRD: Unit Testing Coverage (R-082)

Requirement ID: R-082
Source: requirements.md Section 18 (Testing Strategy)
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-02

## Summary

Establish consistent unit test coverage for pure functions and critical logic paths ensuring fast feedback and preventing regressions in core algorithms (normalization rules, retrieval scoring helpers, utilities).

## Problem / Opportunity

Lack of systematic unit tests increases regression risk and debugging time. Structured coverage requirements drive discipline and confidence.

## Goals

- Minimum 80% line coverage per package (excluding generated code).
- Snapshot tests for normalization output.
- Deterministic seeding for random-dependent utilities.

## Non-Goals

- 100% coverage (diminishing returns beyond target).
- Performance benchmarks (separate effort).

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I get immediate failure if a utility behavior changes unexpectedly.
2. As a reviewer, I see coverage report gating merge.
3. As a maintainer, I refactor with confidence due to test safety net.

## Functional Scope

- Coverage instrumentation via test runner.
- Coverage threshold enforcement in CI.
- Helpers for common test data builders.

## Out of Scope

- E2E flows (R-086).

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN new package WHEN added THEN fails CI if <80% coverage.
- GIVEN normalization rule change WHEN tests run THEN snapshot diff highlights change.
- GIVEN coverage threshold lowered WHEN CI runs THEN pipeline fails (prevent silent drop).
- All criteria trace back to R-082.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Per-package Coverage %.
- Snapshot Churn Rate (monitor noisy volatility).

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Snapshot overuse → Mitigation: Targeted snapshots + review.
- Risk: Flaky tests → Mitigation: Deterministic seeds.

## Dependencies

- Build pipeline (R-022).

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Ensure test data excludes real PII.

## Performance Considerations

- Parallel test execution to keep runtime low.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- N/A.

## Operational Considerations

- Coverage reports archived in CI.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R082-01: Introduce mutation testing later?

## Alternatives Considered

- No coverage gating — Rejected (quality risk).

## Definition of Done

- Coverage threshold enforced.
- Builder utilities provided.
- Docs on test writing standards.

## Appendix (Optional)

Coverage command sample (conceptual): `vitest --coverage`.
