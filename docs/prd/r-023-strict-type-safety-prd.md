# PRD: R-023 Strict Type Safety Configuration

Requirement ID: R-023
Source: requirements.md Section 4

## Summary

Maintain a strict, non-relaxable TypeScript configuration ensuring early detection of defects and alignment with development standards.

## Problem / Opportunity

Relaxing strict flags leads to runtime bugs and erodes trust in types. Enforcing them prevents type debt accumulation.

## Goals

- Enforce strict compiler flags (strict, noImplicitAny, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, etc.)
- Block introduction of `any` without documented exception
- Provide script to verify no regression in tsconfig

## User Stories

1. As a reviewer, I can see CI fail if a PR attempts to loosen tsconfig.
2. As a developer, I receive actionable compiler errors guiding proper narrowing.

## Functional Scope

- Locked tsconfig with checksum or CI guard
- ESLint rules aligning with DS-002/DS-003
- Pre-commit or CI script verifying config hash

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN an edit removing or disabling a strict flag THEN CI fails.
- GIVEN code using implicit any THEN lint fails.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Count of implicit any occurrences = 0
- Number of tsconfig relax attempts blocked

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Overhead for rapid prototyping â†’ Mitigation: Use isolated playground files excluded from build.

## Dependencies

- Development standards DS-*; R-022 incremental pipeline for fast feedback

## Open Questions

- Should we auto-generate a report of newly introduced `unknown` requiring narrowing documentation?

## Definition of Done

- Tsconfig guard active, failing test case demonstrated, documentation updated.
