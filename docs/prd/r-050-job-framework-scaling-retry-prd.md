# PRD: Job Framework Scaling & Retry (R-050)

Requirement ID: R-050
Source: requirements.md Section 11 (Jobs & Asynchronous Processing)
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-01

## Summary

Provide scaling strategies and standardized retry with exponential backoff for the job framework to ensure throughput and resilience under variable load.

## Problem / Opportunity

Static concurrency and naive retry cause either wasted resources or cascading failures. Configurable scaling and backoff policies stabilize the system.

## Goals

- Exponential backoff retry policy with jitter.
- Per-job-type concurrency configuration.
- Metrics-driven scaling guidance.

## Non-Goals

- Full auto-scaler controller implementation (manual/infra-level scaling initially).
- Distributed priority scheduling.

## User Stories

1. As an operator, I configure higher concurrency for embedding jobs than ingestion.
2. As a developer, I mark a job as non-retryable to fail fast.
3. As a maintainer, I observe retry metrics to tune thresholds.

## Functional Scope

- Retry policy module (exponential + jitter, capped attempts).
- Concurrency config loader (env or config file).
- Metrics: attempts, success after retry, permanent failures.

## Out of Scope

- Dynamic runtime policy edits via API (reload on deploy only initially).
- Circuit breaker for external dependencies (future enhancement).

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN transient failure WHEN job retried THEN delay grows exponentially within cap.
- GIVEN max attempts exceeded WHEN reached THEN job moves to DLQ with reason.
- GIVEN concurrency config change WHEN redeployed THEN new parallelism active.
- All criteria trace back to R-050.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Average Attempts per Successful Job.
- Permanent Failure Rate.
- Concurrency Utilization.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Thundering herd on retry → Mitigation: Jitter.
- Risk: Misconfigured high concurrency → Mitigation: Guardrails & warnings.
- Risk: Infinite retry loops → Mitigation: Hard cap + DLQ.

## Dependencies

- Async processing (R-046), worker deployment (R-047).
- Outbox / re-embedding jobs (R-048, R-049).

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Ensure sensitive data not duplicated across retries/logs.

## Performance Considerations

- Track queue wait vs processing time for capacity planning.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- Dashboard labeling of retry reason codes.

## Operational Considerations

- Scaling handbook with concurrency tuning guidelines.
- Alert on permanent failure rate exceeding threshold.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R050-01: Support per-tenant concurrency quotas later?
- OQ-R050-02: Provide runtime admin command to drain specific job type?

## Alternatives Considered

- Linear retry delay: Rejected (slow convergence under transient failures).
- Unlimited retries: Rejected (resource waste).

## Definition of Done

- Retry policy + concurrency config implemented.
- Metrics/alerts integrated.
- Documentation updated.

## Appendix (Optional)

Backoff formula: `delay = min(base * 2^attempt + jitter, maxDelay)`.
