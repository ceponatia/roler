# PRD: R-001 Extensible Framework

Requirement ID: R-001
Source: requirements.md Section 2
Status: Draft
Owner: PRODUCT
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary

Provide an extensible framework for dynamic narrative and structured entity state management (framework not fixed engine) supporting safe customization and upgrade paths.

## Problem / Opportunity

Need flexible extension without forking core; prevents fragmentation and accelerates feature innovation.

## Goals

- Core abstractions (entities, attributes, retrieval, normalization)
- Extension registration and lifecycle hooks
- Semantic versioned public API surface

## Non-Goals

- Extension marketplace infrastructure
- Paid monetization tooling

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I extend entity behavior without modifying core packages.
2. As a GM, I customize entities & rules yet still receive upstream updates.
3. As a plugin author, I register new attribute processors via a documented interface.

## Functional Scope

- Extension registry (discovery + registration order)
- Version compatibility checks (peer requirement ranges)
- Hook points: normalization, retrieval context enrichment, pre-save validation

## Out of Scope

- Remote fetching of third-party extensions
- Runtime sandboxing of untrusted code

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a sample extension package WHEN installed THEN framework loads it via registry.
- GIVEN an incompatible version range THEN load is rejected with clear error.
- GIVEN extension adds attribute hook THEN retrieval includes its enrichment in context.
- Public API surface documented and under semantic version control.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Time to implement reference extension < 2 engineer hours
- Number of maintained reference extensions ≥ 3

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Extension conflicts → Mitigation: namespaced identifiers + collision detection.
- Risk: API churn → Mitigation: deprecation policy + versioned capability flags.

## Dependencies

- Contracts package schemas
- Strict type safety (R-023)

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Extensions cannot access restricted GM-only data unless declared capability granted.

## Performance Considerations

- Hook execution adds <5% overhead to baseline request processing.

## Operational Considerations

- Feature flag to disable third-party extensions at deploy time.

## Open Questions

- Should extension manifests declare resource limits?

## Alternatives Considered

- Hard-coded extension points only (rejected: inflexible)
- Dynamic eval of scripts (rejected: security risk)

## Definition of Done

- Registry implemented, three reference extensions published, docs + tests added, performance overhead benchmark recorded.
