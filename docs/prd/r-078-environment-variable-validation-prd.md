# PRD: Environment Variable Validation (R-078)

Requirement ID: R-078
Source: requirements.md Section 17 (Security & Access Controls)
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-02

## Summary

Validate all required environment variables at startup using shared schema, aborting boot on invalid or missing configuration to prevent undefined runtime behavior.

## Problem / Opportunity

Silent misconfiguration leads to subtle runtime errors. Early validation provides fast feedback and operational safety.

## Goals

- Central env schema covering database, redis, vector backend, feature flags.
- Single import producing typed config object.
- Fail-fast with descriptive error list.

## Non-Goals

- Dynamic runtime mutation of environment variables.
- Loading .env profiles beyond baseline (one active set).

## User Stories

1. As an operator, I see startup error listing missing env variables.
2. As a developer, I get typed access (no string indexing).
3. As a security reviewer, I confirm no secrets logged (only variable names, not values).

## Functional Scope

- Zod (or equivalent) schema parse on process start.
- Type export for config consumer modules.
- Masking of secret values in error output.

## Out of Scope

- Secrets rotation mechanism.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN missing required variable WHEN startup THEN process exits non-zero with message.
- GIVEN invalid boolean flag WHEN startup THEN failure emitted with variable name.
- GIVEN valid config WHEN loaded THEN repeated accesses reuse single object (singleton).
- All criteria trace back to R-078.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Startup Config Failure Count.
- Mean Time to Detect Misconfig (reduced).

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Overly strict optional fields → Mitigation: Clear default semantics documented.
- Risk: Logging secrets accidentally → Mitigation: Redact value printing.

## Dependencies

- Deployment & config strategy (R-094, R-095).

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Do not print secret contents; only keys.

## Performance Considerations

- One-time parse cost negligible.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- N/A.

## Operational Considerations

- Health endpoint includes config hash (non-secret) for drift detection.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R078-01: Provide CLI to validate env pre-deploy?

## Alternatives Considered

- Lazy access with on-demand validation — Rejected (late failure risk).

## Definition of Done

- Schema implemented.
- Tests for success/failure cases.
- Docs enumerating required vars.

## Appendix (Optional)

Example variable list (names only): DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL.
