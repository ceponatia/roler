# PRD: Automated Test Framework (R-018)

Requirement ID: R-018
Source: requirements.md Section 3 (Platform & Technology)
Status: Accepted
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-29

## Summary

Deliver a comprehensive automated testing framework spanning unit, integration (with ephemeral infrastructure), and end-to-end flows to ensure functional correctness, performance safeguards, and regression detection prior to release.

## Problem / Opportunity

Manual testing is slow, inconsistent, and insufficient for evolving complex retrieval and normalization logic. A layered automated suite increases confidence, accelerates iteration, and enforces quality gates (DoD alignment).

## Goals

- Fast feedback (unit tests <30s baseline) for pure logic.
- Deterministic integration environment provisioning (containers for DB/Redis).
- Stable E2E scenario coverage for core user journeys gating merges.

## Non-Goals

- Full load/performance testing harness (handled separately later).
- Cross-browser UI automation beyond primary modern browser initially.

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I can run unit tests quickly to validate logic before committing.
2. As QA, I can trigger integration tests that spin up ephemeral Postgres/Redis automatically.
3. As a release manager, I rely on a green E2E pipeline signaling readiness to merge.

## Functional Scope

- Vitest configuration for unit & integration (testcontainers / docker).
- E2E runner (Playwright or similar) with tagged scenarios (smoke, regression, extended).
- Test data fixtures & factory utilities.
- Coverage reporting & threshold enforcement.

## Out of Scope

- Chaos engineering tests.
- Synthetic production traffic replay.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN unit test suite WHEN executed on baseline hardware THEN total runtime ≤30s.
- GIVEN integration test run WHEN started THEN ephemeral databases & cache auto-provision and teardown after completion.
- GIVEN core E2E scenario (create entity → chat → modify entity → retrieval updated) WHEN pipeline runs THEN it passes reliably (≥99% success over rolling window).
- GIVEN coverage report WHEN generated THEN thresholds (e.g., 80% statements/branches) met or build fails.
- All criteria trace back to R-018.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Unit Suite Runtime: ≤30s.
- E2E Success Rate: ≥99% (excluding infra flake retries).
- Coverage Percentage (Statements): ≥80%.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Flaky E2E tests → Mitigation: Isolation fixtures, retry on known transient selectors, test id attributes.
- Risk: Slow integration spin-up → Mitigation: Parallelization + container reuse where safe.
- Risk: Coverage chasing trivial tests → Mitigation: Qualitative review guidelines.

## Dependencies

- Centralized validation (R-017) for consistent test inputs.
- Data access layer (R-016) for fixtures.

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Test data sanitized; no real PII committed.
- Secrets injected via test-specific env with minimal scope.

## Performance Considerations

- Track regression in test runtime; alert on >20% increase week-over-week.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- E2E tests should include basic accessibility checks (e.g., aria roles) for critical pages.

## Operational Considerations

- CI parallel shards for E2E tags.
- Nightly full regression including extended tags.
- Flake triage workflow documented.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R018-01: Adopt Playwright vs Cypress for E2E? (Playwright leaning given multi-browser capability.)
- OQ-R018-02: Define minimal accessibility assertion set now or in separate PRD?

## Alternatives Considered

- Pure integration tests without E2E: Rejected (misses UI regressions & streaming issues).
- Snapshot-only testing: Rejected (brittle, low semantic value).

## Definition of Done

- Test harness scripts & configs merged.
- Example integration & E2E tests passing in CI.
- Coverage thresholds enforced.

## Appendix (Optional)

Illustrative tag strategy: @smoke (≤2m), @core (gates merges), @extended (nightly).
