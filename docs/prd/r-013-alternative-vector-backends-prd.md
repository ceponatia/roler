# PRD: Alternative Vector Backends (R-013)

Requirement ID: R-013
Source: requirements.md Section 3 (Platform & Technology)
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-08-29

## Summary

Introduce support for specialized external vector databases (e.g., Qdrant) selectable via configuration behind a stable retrieval interface, enabling horizontal scalability and advanced ANN capabilities without requiring application code changes.

## Problem / Opportunity

As corpus size and latency requirements exceed relational pgvector performance, a specialized ANN backend improves query speed and cost efficiency. Decoupling retrieval logic via an interface allows seamless migration and dual-read validation.

## Goals

- Pluggable backend implementation behind single Retriever interface (R-041).
- Configuration-driven selection (env / feature flag) without code edits.
- Dual-read variance logging to validate parity before cutover (R-056).

## Non-Goals

- Implementing proprietary tuning UIs for each backend.
- Supporting arbitrary backends without minimal capability contract.

## User Stories

1. As an operator, I can switch from pgvector to Qdrant via a config flag and restart deployment.
2. As a developer, I observe identical retrieval API signatures pre/post switch.
3. As a maintainer, I can review variance metrics during dual-read to ensure correctness.

## Functional Scope

- Backend registry & factory (identifier → implementation instantiation).
- Health/readiness probe per backend with feature capability flags (e.g., filtering, payload metadata).
- Dual-read mode: execute baseline + candidate, log distance deltas and top-k overlap.
- Configuration schema validation (env var / config file) rejecting unknown backend IDs.

## Out of Scope

- Automatic real-time failover between backends.
- Cross-backend replication tooling (handled by outbox R-039/R-049 elsewhere).

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN backend=pgvector WHEN service starts THEN health endpoint reports backend type=pgvector and status=up.
- GIVEN backend=qdrant WHEN service restarts with reachable Qdrant THEN retrieval queries succeed with same API contract.
- GIVEN dual-read enabled WHEN queries execute THEN variance logs include top-k overlap percentage and average distance delta.
- GIVEN unsupported backend id WHEN service starts THEN startup aborts with clear error message.
- All criteria trace back to R-013.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Top-k Overlap Percentage (dual-read): ≥95% before cutover.
- Retrieval p95 Latency Improvement Post-Cutover: ≥30% vs baseline (tracked).
- Dual-read Error Rate: 0% (execution parity).

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Feature disparity (filters, metadata) → Mitigation: Capability negotiation & conditional query features.
- Risk: Increased operational surface area → Mitigation: Minimal config & health probes; clear runbooks.
- Risk: Silent divergence in scores → Mitigation: Dual-read overlap + alert thresholds.

## Dependencies

- Baseline Retriever abstraction (R-041).
- Outbox sync mechanism (R-039) for seeding alternative backend.

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Ensure data sent to external backend excludes restricted attributes (R-059/067/077) via pre-filtering.
- TLS / network policy for managed backend if remote.

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor query latency & memory usage vs baseline.
- Batch ingestion pipeline for seeding large corpora.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- Administrative diagnostics endpoint includes backend name & capabilities.

## Operational Considerations

- Feature flag: VECTOR_BACKEND with allowed values (pgvector, qdrant,...).
- Dual-read flag: VECTOR_DUAL_READ=true triggers variance logging.
- Cutover playbook documented.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R013-01: Minimum overlap threshold to allow cutover (90%, 95%, 98%)?
- OQ-R013-02: Retention period for variance logs.

## Alternatives Considered

- Hard-switch without dual-read: Rejected (risk of silent regression).
- Direct provider SDK calls scattered in code: Rejected (locks architecture, increases coupling).

## Definition of Done

- Backend interface + implementations delivered.
- Dual-read metrics logged & sample analysis documented.
- Health endpoint surfaces backend & status.
- Configuration validation prevents unsupported IDs.

## Appendix (Optional)

Sample health response snippet:

```json
{
"backend": "qdrant",
"status": "up",
"capabilities": { "filtering": true, "payload": true }
}
```
