# PRD: Unified Retrieval Interface (R-041)

Requirement ID: R-041
Source: requirements.md Section 10 (Retrieval / RAG)
Status: Draft
Owner: Product
Last Updated: 2025-09-01

## Summary

Expose a single Retriever interface abstracting underlying vector backends (pgvector, Qdrant, etc.) enabling consistent querying, scoring, and filtering semantics.

## Problem / Opportunity

Direct backend usage fragments code and complicates future migrations. A stable interface permits backend substitution, dual-read validation, and uniform metrics.

## Goals

- Standard method(s): retrieve(query, k, filters?).
- Backend-agnostic result shape (id, score, metadata).
- Extensible capability flags (filtering, payload fields).

## Non-Goals

- Exposing every backend-specific tuning parameter publicly.
- Implementing learning-to-rank pipeline initially.

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I call Retriever.retrieve without caring about backend specifics.
2. As an operator, I view retrieval metrics aggregated regardless of backend.
3. As a maintainer, I add a new backend implementation behind the interface only.

## Functional Scope

- TypeScript interface + implementations (pg, qdrant).
- Capability negotiation & health reporting.
- Metrics instrumentation (latency, hit count, score distribution).

## Out of Scope

- Cross-backend fallback during runtime errors.
- Query rewriting / semantic expansion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN backend A active WHEN retrieve called THEN returns standardized result array.
- GIVEN backend switch to B WHEN service restarts THEN callers unchanged and tests pass.
- GIVEN capability unsupported (e.g., filter) WHEN used THEN clear error or fallback documented.
- All criteria trace back to R-041.

## Metrics / KPIs

- Retrieval Success Rate.
- p95 Retrieval Latency.
- Backend Switch Effort (qualitative; no code changes needed).

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Leaky abstractions → Mitigation: Minimal surface; capability flags.
- Risk: Divergent score ranges → Mitigation: Score normalization option.
- Risk: Overhead layer adds latency → Mitigation: Thin pass-through design.

## Dependencies

- Vector store strategy (R-038, R-056).
- Embeddings (R-043).

## Security / Privacy Considerations

- Filter restricted data prior to retrieval return.

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize allocations in hot path; reuse object pools if needed.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- Developer docs highlight usage patterns.

## Operational Considerations

- Health endpoint lists backend + capabilities.

## Open Questions

- OQ-R041-01: Normalize scores to [0,1]?
- OQ-R041-02: Provide streaming retrieval results (progressive)?

## Alternatives Considered

- Direct calls throughout code: Rejected (migration risk).
- Complex service layer early: Rejected (YAGNI).

## Definition of Done

- Interface + at least two implementations.
- Metrics & health integrated.
- Documentation with examples added.

## Appendix (Optional)

Interface sketch:

```ts
interface Retriever { retrieve(q: string, k: number, filters?: Filters): Promise<Result[]> }
```

Template compliance confirmed.
