# Development Standard: DS-012 Central Schema Repository

Standard ID: DS-012
Category: Validation / Architecture
Status: Accepted
Owner: Engineering
Last Updated: 2025-09-29
Version: 1.0.0

## 1. Summary

All externally consumed schemas reside in a single contracts package to eliminate duplication and drift.

## 2. Rationale

- Single source of truth reduces mismatches between client & server.

## 3. Normative Requirement Statement

> Schemas for public APIs, env config, and persistence boundaries MUST live in `@contracts`; duplication or local redefinition is prohibited.

## 6. Examples

`packages/contracts/src/env.ts` defining `EnvSchema` used by config loader.

## 7. Implementation Guidance

- Re-export aggregated index to simplify imports.

## 8. Tooling & Enforcement

- ESLint restricted imports forbidding deep internal schema copies.

## 10. Related Standards

- DS-006, DS-013.

## 12. Risks if Violated

- Divergent validation rules, inconsistent error handling.
