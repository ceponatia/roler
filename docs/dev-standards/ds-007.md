# Development Standard: DS-007 Prefer Immutability

Standard ID: DS-007
Category: Architecture / Typing
Status: Accepted
Owner: Engineering
Last Updated: 2025-09-29
Version: 1.0.0

## 1. Summary

Encourages immutable data structures (`readonly` arrays/objects) except where mutation is explicitly required, reducing side-effect bugs.

## 2. Rationale

- Simplifies reasoning, enables safer concurrency.

## 3. Normative Requirement Statement

> Shared data structures MUST be treated as immutable; prefer `readonly` annotations and defensive copying over in-place mutation.

## 6. Examples

```ts
function add(a: readonly number[]): number { return a.reduce((s,v)=>s+v,0) }
```

## 7. Implementation Guidance

- Use spread to derive new objects; avoid pushing into shared arrays.

## 8. Tooling & Enforcement

- ESLint rule suggestions (`functional/immutable-data` optional).

## 10. Related Standards

- DS-010 pure functions.

## 12. Risks if Violated

- Hidden side effects, state corruption.
