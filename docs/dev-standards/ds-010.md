# Development Standard: DS-010 Favor Pure Functions

Standard ID: DS-010
Category: Architecture
Status: Draft
Owner: Engineering
Last Updated: 2025-09-02
Version: 1.0.0

## 1. Summary

Promotes writing side-effect free pure functions for business logic, isolating I/O at boundaries for easier testing and reasoning.

## 2. Rationale

- Improves determinism, simplifies test scenarios, facilitates property testing (R-087).

## 3. Normative Requirement Statement

> Core domain and transformation logic SHOULD be implemented as pure functions; side effects MUST be isolated in thin boundary layers.

## 6. Examples

Pure: `normalizeEntity(input, rules)` vs function that mutates global state.

## 7. Implementation Guidance

- Inject dependencies (retriever, clock) as parameters.

## 8. Tooling & Enforcement

- Architectural review; potential static analysis later.

## 12. Risks if Violated

- Hard-to-reason side effects, nondeterministic tests.
