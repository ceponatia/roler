Standard ID: DS-015
Category: Error Handling
Status: Accepted
Owner: Engineering
Last Updated: 2025-09-29
Version: 1.0.0

## 1. Summary

Defines a single error shape across services for consistent logging, client handling, and metrics aggregation.

## 2. Rationale

- Simplifies client parsing, supports error code analytics.

## 3. Normative Requirement Statement

> All surfaced application errors MUST conform to canonical `{ code, message, details? }` schema defined in `@contracts/errors`.

## 6. Examples

```ts
return err({ code: 'NotFound', message: 'Game not found' })
```

## 7. Implementation Guidance

- Provide factory helpers; avoid throwing plain strings.

## 8. Tooling & Enforcement

- Runtime assertion in error mapping utility; tests for shape.

## 10. Related Standards

- DS-011 results, DS-016 logging metadata, DS-017 codes.

## 12. Risks if Violated

- Inconsistent client handling, lost observability.
