### Why not include PRDs/specs here

They change at a different cadence, are long-form, and are better maintained in the main repo. We link to them when helpful.

### What parts are implemented

As of now, the extensions foundation (schemas for the extension system) and the low-latency retrieval strategy (pgvector-backed) are implemented. See Status for details.

### Where are the APIs

This wiki documents concepts and modules. Concrete API docs will be added as more of the application is built.
