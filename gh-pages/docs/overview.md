description: What Roler is and how this wiki is organized
---

Roler is a SvelteKit + Postgres/pgvector + Redis + Ollama system with Prisma and Zod at the boundaries. This wiki focuses on how the application works. It intentionally excludes project documents like requirements, PRDs, and tech specs. Where helpful, we link to those documents on GitHub without embedding them here.

What you’ll find here:

- Getting started with the docs site and contribution rules
- Current status of the system
- Core concepts (architecture, data model, validation + errors, retrieval)
- Walkthroughs for the parts that exist today (Extensions foundation and Low-latency Retrieval)

Out of scope for this site:

- Requirements, PRDs, tech specs, and design documents (kept in the repository under `docs/`)

If you need the full design documents, browse the repository’s `/docs` folder.
