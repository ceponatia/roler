- Why partial results? Deadlines; deterministic smaller set beats stalling.
- Does partial reduce quality? Top items remain relevant; you get fewer.
- What is AdaptiveK? One-time K expansion when filters drop too much and time allows.
- Latency regressions? Tune baseK, indexes, caches; see Grafana panels.
